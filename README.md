Cosmic ray measurements of atmospheric structure.

Cosmic rays interact in the upper atmosphere and produce secondary 
particles some of which reach the ground. Because the particles (or 
their parent particles, or grandparent particles, etc.) lose energy 
depending on the density of air, their energies at ground level  
reflect this information to a greater or lesser degree.
